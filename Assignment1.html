            <h3>My Interest in IT</h3>
            <p>My interest in IT revolves around the idea of technology evolving over the years, making it more than just a tool and rather a proper personal digital assistant. An example of this can be smartphones, from being just a basic device which can access the internet and play to something which can be a mini PC when set up correctly. Another example can be foldables as they have the potential to become the next step for smartphones and I am interested in how they can optimise the device to make the most out of it. All this encourages me to be a part of the next big thing in the mobile industry either by designing or developing applications which can further enhance the new technology to come. My interest in IT all started off when a friend of mine introduced me to a launcher called Nano Launcher. At that time I was fascinated as the laggy touchwiz was replaced with something that felt useable, this eventually evolved into my curiosity in android customization such as experimenting with other launchers and widgets and also using mods to improve performance such as using custom ROMS and flashing files from XDA.</p> 

            <p>I chose to go to RMIT because I enquired with few people and they said the way of teaching at RMIT is better for computer related subjects and the industry connections can provide opportunities after getting a degree. The prerequisite requirements at RMIT also fit better to my abilities. Since the campus is in the city it allows me to experience a new busy environment completely different to a suburban lifestyle. This is useful as after graduation, many IT related jobs are located in the city and it will be quicker for me to navigate to it compared to graduating from a different university.</p>
        
            <p>During my studies I expect to further enhance my current knowledge of information technology as a whole, this includes understanding how to write code efficiently, improve my understanding of databases as a whole and to be able to work better in a group. At the end of my studies I would like to have a clear goal as to which part of the IT industry Iâ€™m well suited for based on the skills and knowledge gained.
