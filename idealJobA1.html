        <p>As mentioned in the description, the job is a software developer for the Google Pixel team. The role of the developer is to apply their knowledge and skills into creating the ‘future of Pixel devices,’ this means developers are required to be capable enough to work in a fast-paced dynamic environment and also be a jack of all trades in the development itself. Google prefers applicants who have a Master’s degree or PhD in Computer Science or other related fields, 2 years of application development and have experience in developing accessible technologies (careers.google.com).  In practice developers need to be able to write code as well as read code from other developers, maintain existing content with updates and decide what is best for stakeholders. What I have right now is basic knowledge in Python, HTML, CSS and very little knowledge in PHP. I have attempted creating an Android application written in Java and connected the app to Google’s Firebase database. To meet the preferred requirements I first need experience in the development industry so that I can gain the necessary communication and group collaborative skills. To achieve this job after getting a bachelor's degree will help. While working, in my spare time I could learn how to develop apps using Java and Kotlin as they are very popular languages in Android applications. After gaining the preliminary requirements, I can move on to getting a Master’s degree and find a job related to Android application development. </p>
